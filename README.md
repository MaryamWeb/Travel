## Java Travel Planner
### Introduction
My goal for the project was to build a website using java, MySQL and Spring.

The website will allow you to create an account, view all the available trips and their activities. Also, you can join any trip and choose the activity you would like to join. On your personal page, you can view all trips that you added.


The website is built using Java/Spring Boot for the backend with MySQL database and styled with Bootstrap.
